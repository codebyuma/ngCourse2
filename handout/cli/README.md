# Part _____ : The Angular CLI

Getting started with Angular 2 can sometimes feel overwhelming with all of the configuration and setup steps required.

The [Angular command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), currently in beta, was developed to make it easier and faster to set up Angular 2 projects. You no longer need to remember the structure of components or spend time piecing together your build tools and environment/pipeline - with a few commands, the Angular CLI will spin it all up for you automatically. All generated projects follow the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/styleguide).

Projects generated through the CLI come set up with the tools configured and ready for you to lint, format, test, build, serve and even deploy your app. 

The Angular-CLI is based on the [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) project.
