# Generate new components

Once the basic project is ready, you can use the CLI to generate and add the various components, in a general sense, that you need for your app.

You can create other scaffolds/templates for Angular components using the `ng generate` (or `ng g`) command:

Item       | Command                 | Files generated
---        | ---                     | --- 
Component: | `ng g component [name]` | component, HTML, CSS, test spec files
Directive: | `ng g directive [name]` | component, test spec files
Pipe:      | `ng g pipe [name]`      | component, test spec files
Service:   | `ng g service [name]`   | component, test spec files
Class:     | `ng g class [name]`     | component, test spec files 
Route:     | `ng g route [name]`     | component, HTML, CSS, test spec files (in new folder) 

By running each of the above commands, the CLI will generate the appropriate files for you - named and linked together. You can then go in and edit the files appropriately to customize and build out your app.
